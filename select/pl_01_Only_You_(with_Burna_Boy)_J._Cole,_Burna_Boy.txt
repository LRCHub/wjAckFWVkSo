Sunny days, rainy nights,
I know
She'll be there for me,
no matter what
If I miss your call,
I'ma call back
Never too far,
no, I'm never too far
Bet wherever you are,
that's where I'm at
(Show me where you are)
I don't ever want you
to regret these moves
Sometimes the win
is hidden in the lose
I wish life was longer,
like an interlude
I got way more songs
I wanna sing with you
I thought I was strong
'til I saw what you went through
The birth of my sons,
and each time, my mind was blown
Yeah, each time, my mind was blown
I owe you patience and a lot of grace
I owe you flowers and a Prada date
I owe you time watching movies that I hate
I owe you chocolates and red velvet cake
Oh, wait,
you don't like red velvet no more
Yeah, that's right,
out of spite, hoes jealous of you
Used to write about my life,
but I ain't tellin' no more
Stay the fuck out my business
Drop the triple-double last week
at Lifetime Fitness
Dishwasher broke,
fingers wrinkled gettin' soaked
What's the point of bein' rich
if I gotta do the dishes?
I give a fuck what niggas
think about me
I know they couldn't know
a thing about me
And my loyalty,
she holds you down,
and you gotta move accordingly
I got a good one,
she feel like royalty, uh
I don't ever want you
to regret these moves
Sometimes the win
is hidden in the lose
I wish life was longer,
like an interlude
I got way more songs
I wanna sing with you
I thought I was strong
'til I saw what you went through
The birth of my sons,
and each time, my mind was blown
Yeah, each time, my mind was blown
Ooh
Ooh
Lonely nights with lots of money
Times I wish I had no money
How can I be sure you love me?
It's not like you're betting your
best years on me
Best years on me
Best years on me
Do I like livin' like this?
Maybe I'm fine wasting my time
Beautiful eyes washed down with wine
(Mmh)
Maybe it's time I accept my own
Órí bákan-bákan
Órí bákan-bákan
And it no easy
Because if true love for me today,
then I'm coming
Maybe it's time I accept you, ooh
Longing for
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
I'm not really secure
What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
I'm not really secure
When, when, when, when
Can we see each other again?
Hey
Hey Pa, I've been checking you out
from long distance
Digging your existence,
can I offer my assistance?
They say a dude is only as cool
as his talk is
But I know that you real
because your walk is
You got a beautiful smile,
your heart's big as life
And it's full of gold,
though you pay a heavy price
Nobody knows about the depression
and the strife
And the fight to stand strong
against women who entice
They don't respect your call,
they don't respect your wife
You're tired, and you're weak,
and you could blow it all tonight
'Cause everybody thinks
that you're a man of steel
Like you don't hurt
and you don't feel, but they wrong
I, I swear I've watched you keep
yourself far from the drama
Taking many hits to your armor
I've seen you walk miles
with the crowd,
but alone, you walked farther
Now walk into the arms of your father
And let him build you up and supply
everythin' you've been needin'
I'm here watching,
and I'm interceding
you gon' make it, Pa
